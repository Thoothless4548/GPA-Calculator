# GPA-Calculator
GPA calculator by anagha

GPA Calculator is a PHP script for calculating high school GPAs. It's designed to be as adaptive yet simple as possible. And it's even condensed in one tiny script for you to run. 
• We also have a Java version that works well and an experimental Python version that we are still developing. They have their own GitHub repositories, which you may find under the names "GPA Calculator Java" and "GPA Calculator Python." The HTML/JavaScript version is hosted on this repo under the "html" folder, and is completely independent from the original PHP version. 
• Talking about the project, it contains a user and admin side from where a user can manage grading easily. From the admin panel, he/she can manage teacher’s account. The Admin plays an important role in the management of the system. In this project, the user has to perform all the main functions from the Admin side.
